# radsec
This project documents the setup and configuration of RadSec (RADIUS over TLS) using FreeRADIUS on a Linux server and a MikroTik router as the client (you can use any client. The server configuration stays the same). It covers certificate management, server configuration, and secure authentication to ensure encrypted RADIUS communication.
